## Project management

The purpose of this project is to develop and promote a project management system available through the web for organizing and managing projects.

In the context of computer engineering few things are as important as a good project manager for group projects, having that in mind we decided to develop a simple but effective one.

The platform will have a very simplistic design, with minimal clutter and optimal performance. Fast search engine and intuitive UI will allow anyone to participate in discussion forums, create task lists and organize groups. In addition, each task can be commented on by other users. It'll also be multiplatform (desktop, smartphone).

Finally the users will be placed into 2 categories with different permissions, users and administrators. Administrators are able to ban users and delete content.
