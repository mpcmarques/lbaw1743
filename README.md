# A1: Project Management
> The purpose of this project is to develop and promote a project management system available through the web for organizing and managing projects, sustained by advertisement.
>Currently, whatever the field may be, there's always the need to organize your project properly if you want to maximize success. With that in mind we decided to develop a web based project management system with emphasis on simplicity and efficiency, such that organizing and updating a project and it's tasks becomes a fast and easy process. 
>  Users may be associated with multiple projects. Each project has a team, task lists, and also a discussion forum for members of the project. Task lists can be organized into groups. Associated with each task can also be comments from other users. There are only two types of permissions in the context of a project: the coordinator and the common users. The coordinator is able to remove users from a project.
> Finally the users will be placed into 2 categories with different permissions, users and administrators. Users have access to all of the features and administrators are able to ban users and delete content.
